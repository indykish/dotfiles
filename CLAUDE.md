# Oracle Operating Model

This file is a thin pointer to the canonical [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md).

- Update policy and workflow guidance in `AGENTS.md` only.
- Keep this file in sync by updating the pointer if the path changes.
- Dotfile edits (`.*`) must be preceded by a timestamped backup; follow the rule in `AGENTS.md`.
- Team shorthand compatibility (legacy CTO/Senior Engineer language) is defined in `AGENTS.md` under `Legacy Team Lenses (AGENTS_OLD Compatibility)`.
- Oracle review defaults (inline CTO/Engineer lens primary, `@indykish/oracle` CLI secondary) are defined in `AGENTS.md` under `Tool Commands (Primary)` and `skills/oracle/SKILL.md`.
