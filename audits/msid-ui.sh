# msid-ui.sh — single awk pass over the diff, running the two
# discipline checks that share a regex pass (MS-ID + UI substitution).
# Previously `combined.sh`; renamed once the PUB clause moved to
# zlint + agent chat-output discipline (see commit history).
#
# Emits per-line hits for:
#   * MS-ID — milestone-id leak in source/config (M{N}_{NNN}, §X.Y, T{N},
#             dim {N}.{N}) outside docs/ + node_modules/ + vendor/.
#             Test files are NOT exempt (RULE TST-NAM).
#   * UI    — raw HTML element in ui/packages/app/*.{tsx,jsx} where a
#             design-system primitive exists (UI Component Substitution Gate).
#
# Non-empty hit list → exit 1. Otherwise exit 0 + one OK line.
#
# Note on PUB:
#   This script no longer flags `pub` declarations. The PUB GATE
#   (docs/gates/pub-surface.md) has two mechanical enforcers and one
#   human one; this script was a fourth, redundant layer:
#     * Orphan check ("is anyone using this pub?") → zlint's
#       `unused-decls: error` rule, run by `make lint` later in the
#       same pre-commit pass. A `pub` with no in-tree consumer fails
#       there. The audit's regex was duplicating this signal with
#       false positives (e.g. variant lines inside private blocks)
#       and no way to distinguish necessary pubs from gratuitous ones.
#     * Design call ("is this pub shape right?") → the agent's
#       chat-printed PUB GATE verdict block, which the script cannot
#       see by construction. A regex on `^pub ` was approximating
#       this as friction, but produced unfixable false positives on
#       every legitimate new public surface and had no override path.
#   Removing the PUB clause aligns with the gate body's own design
#   (which already delegates mechanical work to zlint and design work
#   to the agent's chat output).
#
# Per-check scope (M70):
#   Unlike the rest of the audit-*.sh family, this script stays
#   diff-shaped (asserts on *added* `^\+` lines, not file state).
#   Each sub-check's rule is shaped as "don't introduce X" rather than
#   "X must not exist anywhere", so a full-codebase scan would change
#   the semantic:
#     * MS-ID — flags milestone identifiers added in this commit.
#               Historical docs in `done/` legitimately contain them,
#               and code comments may reference them in old commits.
#               Only newly-added M{N}_{NNN} citations should fail.
#     * UI    — flags raw HTML primitives added now where a design-system
#               component exists. Legacy raw-HTML in unrelated files is
#               cleaned by the touch-it-fix-it rule (RULE NLR), not by
#               this audit's scope.
#
#   Conversion to full-codebase scope is a separate research spec — see
#   M70_001 §3 + Failure Modes. The M70 thesis (pre-commit sees staged
#   content) holds here too: `git diff --cached` reads the index, so the
#   staged-not-committed slip is not a risk for this script's checks.
#
# Modes:
#   --staged  (default) diff against `git diff --cached -U0`
#             — pre-commit context; index includes staged content
#   --diff              diff against origin/main (vs BASE...HEAD)
#             — used by `make harness-verify-all` periodic deep audit
#
# Gate bodies:
#   docs/gates/milestone-id.md
#   docs/gates/ui-substitution.md
#   docs/gates/pub-surface.md  (handled by zlint + agent chat output, not this script)
