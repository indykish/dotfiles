#
# The DOC READ GATE asks an agent to read the façade its edit triggers, and
# then asks the same agent whether it did. That is a claim about itself
# compared against nothing. `log` records the read and `check` compares the
# record against the façades the staged files trigger.
#
# NOTHING HERE MAY DEPEND ON AN AGENT RUNTIME. `log` is a shell command any
# agent can run; a runtime that also has a read hook (Claude Code today) can
# call it automatically, and a runtime that removes that feature tomorrow
# changes nothing — the agent runs the command, the record is identical, the
# gate behaves the same. Vendor-shaped configuration stays out of this file and
# out of .githooks/, and an eval fails the build if it appears
# (evals/ledger/run.sh, ledger_doc_read_runtime_neutral).
#
# The record lives in the git directory, never in the tree: it is evidence
# about one working copy, not shared history. When it is absent — an agent
# runtime with no hook support — `check` warns and exits 0. Partial
# mechanization stated honestly beats a red that means nothing.
#
# Exit: 0 clean or unenforceable · 1 unread trigger · 2 usage error.
