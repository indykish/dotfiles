  Generates risk-weighted, failure-injecting tests across 9 stacks (Python, Python SDK,
  OpenAPI, JS/TS CLI, React/TS, Zig, Rust, Go, Shell). Enforces behaviour + failure +
  invariant + integration + regression coverage with explicit anti-patterns and a
  Definition-of-Done gate. Adds deterministic production-safety proofs: Zig zero-leak
  (error paths included), concurrency proven at >=100 connections (no hidden global
  lock), and a counter-based complexity/latency budget that escalates O(n) and
  serialization findings to a refactor proposal. Use during implementation, not after.

# Write Unit Test

Generate tests that catch bugs before they ship. Tests run *during* implementation, not after.

## Test quality bar

Every test answers three questions. If it answers none, delete it.

1. **What bug would this catch?**
2. **What behaviour does this prove?**
3. **What invariant does this enforce?**

A green test that answers none of these is worse than no test — it's false confidence.

## Truth hierarchy

When sources disagree, trust in this order:

1. **Runtime behaviour** — prod logs, incidents, observed traces
2. **Spec** — `docs/v*/active/M*.md`, PR description, milestone doc
3. **Code** — current implementation

Spec contradicts runtime → surface the conflict before testing. Code contradicts spec → spec wins; test the spec, flag the code as a defect.

## First steps

1. **Read the spec, then the code** — spec defines what to test; code is what gets tested. Don't let code shape expectations.
2. **Read `docs/greptile-learnings/RULES.md`** — every rule is a regression test.
3. **Detect the stack** from project files (`pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `build.zig`, `package.json` + `react`/`bin`, `*.sh`, `openapi.yaml`).
4. **Run the existing suite first** — establish the green baseline before adding tests.
5. **Follow existing naming and fixture conventions.**

## Three execution modes

Pick one. Don't run all categories on every file.

| Mode | When | Required categories |
|---|---|---|
| **Change-set** | Standard PR, isolated fix | Behaviour, Failure, Integration, Regression |
| **Hardening** | Critical paths: auth, money, data integrity, migrations, distributed ops | + Invariant, Concurrency, Fuzz |
| **Deep audit** | Infra/core, dependency upgrade, full release QA, security review | All categories + Performance + Contract |

Auto-detect from diff: auth/payment/migration/concurrency/streaming files → Hardening. Otherwise → Change-set.

## Risk-weighted priority

Within each mode, write tests in this order. Stop when you've covered the surface.

1. **State transitions** — PENDING→RUNNING, idempotent vs not, monotonic
2. **External boundaries** — I/O, network, DB, FS, IPC
3. **Concurrency paths** — races, ordering, double-fire
4. **Error handling branches** — every `catch`, `orelse`, `?`, `Result::Err`, `try/except`
5. **Pure functions** — last; usually low bug density

A string helper does not get the same treatment as a distributed retry loop. Allocate effort by blast radius.

---

## Five test categories

### 1. Behaviour
Input → exact output shape AND side effects. Assert *both*. Asserting only the return value misses DB writes, event emits, log lines, state changes.

### 2. Failure (≥50% of all tests)
- **Specific error contracts** — type + message + structured fields (status code, error code, hint). Bare `expect error` / `assert.throws` is a smell.
- **Boundaries** — empty, null/None/`Option::None`, max (`i64::MAX`, `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`), overflow, NaN, malformed, truncated, unicode (CJK, emoji, RTL, ZWJ), CRLF/LF, leading/trailing whitespace, embedded newlines.
- **Expected vs fatal distinction** — a function returning null for both timeout (expected) and connection-reset (fatal) causes busy-loops. Test that they take different paths.
- **Auth failures** — no token, expired, wrong role, revoked, rate limited.
- **Downstream errors** — 4xx, 5xx, timeout, DNS, TLS, partial UTF-8, broken pipe.

### 3. Invariant
Properties that must hold across all valid inputs. Use property-based testing (`hypothesis`/`proptest`/`fast-check`/`gopter`) when input domain is large.

- **Idempotency** — N calls = 1 effect. Required for webhooks, retries, distributed ops, PUT semantics.
- **Monotonic state** — RUNNING never goes back to PENDING.
- **No duplicate side effects** — same event ID never processes twice.
- **Eventual consistency** — final state converges regardless of order.
- **Conservation** — sum of debits = sum of credits; total events in = total out + dropped.
- **Schema lock** — no silent field add/remove on stored or wire format.

### 4. Integration
End-to-end through real stack. **Mock only at system boundaries** (network, disk, external APIs, clock, randomness). Never mock internal modules — that validates fake behaviour and integration bugs slip through.

- Full middleware chain executes (auth, rate-limit, logging, CORS).
- Real DB, real serializer, real router. Use containers, not in-memory fakes when behaviour differs.
- For spec claims involving "real-time" / "streaming" / "incremental": assert bytes arrive incrementally — not just that the parser handles pre-buffered data.
- Failure modes named in code → integration test with deterministic injection.

### 5. Regression
Pin behaviour that must not silently change.

- Golden output files — diff on change. Agent must explain *why* a snapshot changed; never silently re-bless.
- Public API surface (`__all__`, exports, header signatures, `@sizeOf`, ABI stability).
- Breaking-change detectors (`oasdiff breaking`, `buf breaking`, `cargo public-api`).
- Old test suite passes against new code on dependency upgrades.

---

## Hard rules

- **Mock only at system boundaries.** No mocking internal modules. No asserting on mocks (`expect(mockFn).toHaveBeenCalled()`) without also asserting outcome state.
- **State isolation per test.** Reset globals, DB rows, fixtures, env vars, caches. Tests must pass under randomised execution order. Run `pytest -p randomly` / `cargo test -- --shuffle` / equivalent at least once per branch.
- **Specific error contracts.** Assert error type AND message AND structured fields.
- **≥50% negative-path tests** on changed surface. If success tests outnumber failure tests, you're not done.
- **Test names read as documentation.** `should_reject_empty_user_id`, `should_retry_on_502_from_gateway`, `should_not_duplicate_event_on_retry`. No `test_1`, `test_basic`, `it works`.
- **No testing private functions directly.** Test through the public surface. If a private function needs direct testing, it's actually public — promote it.
- **No duplicating implementation logic in tests.** A test that re-implements the function under test proves nothing.
- **Tests favour clarity over DRY.** Independence and explicitness beat reuse. Extract a helper only when ≥3 tests share non-trivial setup AND the helper has no logic worth hiding.
- **Untestable claims are flagged**, not silently skipped. Mark `needs infra` in the claim-tracing table.

## Anti-patterns (reject in review)

- ❌ Snapshot-only tests with no behavioural assertion
- ❌ Asserting on mocks instead of outcomes
- ❌ Testing private functions directly
- ❌ Duplicating implementation logic in tests
- ❌ Bare `expect error` / `assert.throws` with no type/message contract
- ❌ Tests that pass only when run in a specific order
- ❌ "Minimum N tests per file" filler that asserts the same invariant N times
- ❌ Mocking internal modules
- ❌ Coverage padding — line coverage with no behavioural claim
- ❌ Hand-wavy performance assertions ("not too slow")
- ❌ Silent golden-file re-blessing on snapshot drift

## Failure injection toolkit

Vague claim: "handles connection reset". Real test: deterministic injection. If you can't reproduce a failure deterministically, the test is fiction.

| Failure | Tool / technique |
|---|---|
| TCP reset / half-open | `toxiproxy`, `tc netem`, raw socket close from peer |
| Slow / delayed response | `toxiproxy` latency, `respx` delay, fake clock |
| Partial read | `io.LimitedReader`, custom `Read` returning short |
| DB connection drop | `pg_terminate_backend()` mid-transaction |
| Timeout | shrink `SO_RCVTIMEO`, `tokio::time::pause()` |
| Clock skew | freeze/advance fake clock; `chrono` mock; `mock-time` |
| Disk full / EIO | `tmpfs` size limit; mock filesystem |
| OOM | `FixedBufferAllocator` (Zig), small heap caps |
| Concurrency races | `loom` (Rust), `-race` (Go), `std.Thread` + barrier |
| Network partition | `iptables`/`pfctl` block, `toxiproxy` down |

Every failure mode named in the spec or code (`catch`, `orelse`, retry loop) needs at least one injection-driven test.

---

## Coverage that matters

Line coverage is noise. Track and report:

- **Branch coverage** — every `if`/`match`/`switch` arm hit
- **Error-path coverage** — every `catch`/`orelse`/`Err` constructed in code is exercised by a test
- **Input-class coverage** — empty / single / many / unicode / malformed each appear at least once per public input

Targets on touched code: branch ≥80%, error-path 100%, negative-path ratio ≥50%.

## Spec integration

When a spec exists with these tables, treat them as authoritative test sources:

| Spec table | Generates |
|---|---|
| Test Specification | One test per row, name = `dim X.Y: <name>` |
| Error Contracts | One negative test per row asserting exact error |
| Failure Modes | One integration test per row with deterministic injection |
| Implementation Constraints | Verification command run + result reported |

If the spec has none of these, build a claim-tracing table from spec prose / PR description:

```
| Claim | Test type | Injection mechanism | Test exists? |
|---|---|---|---|
| "gate results print in real time" | integration (streaming) | partial-read reader | ❌ |
| "heartbeat fires within 30s" | integration (timer) | fake clock | ❌ |
| "no busy-loop on Redis reset" | failure (fatal vs timeout) | `pg_terminate_backend` | ❌ |
```

Every claim → ≥1 test. Untestable claims → flag `needs infra`.

---

## Definition of Done

Reject the change if any are missing on touched code:

- [ ] ≥50% negative-path tests for changed surface
- [ ] Boundary tests: empty, null/None, max, malformed
- [ ] Error contract tests: type + message + structured fields
- [ ] Idempotency check where retries / webhooks / distributed ops apply
- [ ] State isolation: tests pass under random execution order
- [ ] Integration test through real stack for any spec claim involving transport/streaming/real-time
- [ ] Failure-injection test for every failure mode named in code
- [ ] Test names read as documentation
- [ ] No mocking of internal modules
- [ ] Golden-file drift, if any, has a written explanation
- [ ] Branch coverage ≥80%, error-path 100% on touched code
- [ ] **Performance:** counter-based complexity proof on the n-ladder (O-bound asserted) + median-of-K latency vs pinned baseline; N+1 round-trips ruled out
- [ ] **Zig zero-leak:** `make memleak` 0 leaks; every alloc-with-error-path proven by `std.testing.checkAllAllocationFailures`; no cross-request high-water growth over N iters
- [ ] **Concurrency:** ≥100-connection barrier-started test proves exactly-once + parallelism (peak-concurrency/lock-wait counter, or wall-time < R×); passes K runs + race detector clean
- [ ] **Refactor escalation:** any super-linear or serialization finding on touched code carries a refactor proposal (root cause + target design + patch alternative + recommendation) surfaced for decision — not silently band-aided

100% required before declaring done.

## CI execution strategy

| Stage | What runs |
|---|---|
| **PR** | Behaviour + Failure + Regression unit; fast Integration; lint; type-check; randomised order |
| **Pre-merge** | Full Integration; Contract (`oasdiff` / `buf breaking`); coverage delta |
| **Nightly** | Concurrency stress; Fuzz (`schemathesis` / `proptest` / `cargo-fuzz`); Performance benchmarks |
| **Pre-release** | Golden full-suite; cross-platform; memory-leak (`std.testing.allocator`); ABI stability |

A test in the wrong stage either delays PRs or never runs. Place deliberately.

## Production-safety proofs (deterministic & invariant)

These three catch bugs that reach production silently and cost the most to remove.
Each is written to be **deterministic** (same verdict every run) and **invariant**
(independent of machine, load noise, and execution order).

**The rule that governs all three: prefer counters over clocks.** An allocation
count, a query/round-trip count, a lock-wait tally, a peak-concurrency count is
noise-free and reproducible; wall-clock time is not. Where wall-clock is unavoidable
(latency budgets), use **median-of-K runs + a margin** against a **pinned baseline
file**, never a single sample. Where an input space must be covered, prefer
**exhaustive injection** (every allocation site, every interleaving the tool can
enumerate) over sampling.

### Proof 1 — Zig: zero leaks in production, error paths included

"0 leaks" means *every* path frees, including the ones that only run on failure — not
"the happy path didn't leak."

- **Every test allocates via `std.testing.allocator`.** It fails the test on any leak
  or double-free, deterministically. Gate: no test uses `std.heap.page_allocator` or a
  long-lived General Purpose Allocator (GPA); `grep -rn "page_allocator" '**/test*.zig'`
  in test code is empty (or justified per line).
- **Exhaustive error-path proof — `std.testing.checkAllAllocationFailures`.** For every
  function that allocates *and* can return an error, run it under
  `checkAllAllocationFailures` (or a `FailingAllocator` loop): it fails each allocation
  site in turn and asserts the function leaks nothing on the resulting error return.
  This is the *only* acceptable proof that every `errdefer` is correct — "looks right"
  is not. Exhaustive over allocation sites ⇒ deterministic.
- **No cross-request growth.** Drive the full lifecycle (init → handle → deinit, or
  arena acquire → use → reset) for N iterations and assert outstanding-bytes /
  high-water does **not** grow monotonically. A slow leak the single-shot test misses
  shows up here as linear growth.
- **Gate:** `make memleak` → **0 leaks**, output pasted into PR Session Notes; cross-compile
  both targets first (`x86_64-linux`, `aarch64-linux`) — stdlib alloc paths differ from macOS.

### Proof 2 — Concurrency proven at ≥100 connections (no hidden global lock)

The code must be correct **and actually parallel** under real contention. A single
global `Thread.Mutex` makes correctness tests pass while quietly serialising every
request — exactly the regression this proof exists to catch.

- **Real contention, deterministic start.** ≥100 concurrent clients/connections,
  released together off a **barrier** so contention is real and reproducible (not
  staggered by spawn latency).
- **Correctness invariant (the hard gate, fully deterministic):** same row / same
  idempotency key / same lease under the 100-way race → **exactly one effect**, no lost
  update, no corruption. Assert the invariant, not "no crash."
- **Parallelism assertion (catches the global-lock regression):** prove work runs in
  parallel. Cheapest deterministic form is a **counter** — assert peak simultaneous
  in-flight ≥ a threshold, or lock-wait ≈ 0. Where only wall-clock exists, assert 100
  concurrent ops finish in **< R×** a single op (R with margin: a global lock blows past
  ~100×, so R≈10 catches it without flaking), median-of-K.
- **Flush ordering bugs:** run K× under randomised order. `loom` (Rust) enumerates
  interleavings exhaustively — use it where supported; `-race` (Go); for Zig, barrier +
  repeat + invariant assertions.
- **Gate:** the ≥100-connection test passes K consecutive runs; race detector clean where
  available; counters/timing pasted.
- **A serialization bottleneck is a *structural* finding, not a patch target.** If the
  parallelism counter shows one global lock serialising requests, propose the concurrent
  redesign (shard the lock · per-key/per-shard locks · lock-free CAS · read-copy-update),
  not a hack around it — and let the ≥100-connection parallelism counter be the acceptance
  proof of the redesign (Proof 3 optimisation loop, step 3).

### Proof 3 — Performance & complexity budget (and how I optimise to meet it)

A changed hot path declares a latency budget **and** a proven complexity bound — and
when it misses, I optimise deterministically rather than hand-wave "no O(n²)".

- **Complexity by counters (deterministic).** Measure a **work counter** (allocations,
  DB/Redis round-trips, comparisons, bytes scanned) at n, 2n, 4n, 8n and assert the
  growth matches the claim: O(n) → ~doubles per doubling; O(1) → flat; O(n²) → ~4×.
  Counters are noise-free, so the verdict is invariant across machines.
- **N+1 detector (the most common super-linear surprise):** assert round-trip count is
  constant or linear in n, never multiplicative — count at n and 10n.
- **Latency budget (when wall-clock is required):** fixed input + warmup + **median-of-K**
  + p95/p99 threshold + regression threshold vs a **pinned baseline file** (fail at 1.5×
  baseline). Single samples banned — they flake.
- **Conservation:** allocation count bounded; connection / file-descriptor (FD) open-count
  before == after.

**The optimisation loop I run when a budget is missed** (deterministic, repeatable).
Default bias for the perf/concurrency class: **propose the structural refactor, not the
band-aid** — a patched O(n²) or a hacked-around global lock still ships a fragile design.

1. **Measure with counters first**, not a profiler guess — find the term that grows
   super-linearly (the N+1, the O(n²) nested scan, the per-iteration allocation) or the
   **serialization point** (one lock every request waits on).
2. **Classify the fix — local vs structural.** *Local* = a genuine one-liner: add an
   index, hoist one allocation, collapse one N+1 into a join. *Structural* = the data
   structure, locking model, or call graph is wrong: an O(n²) algorithm, a global
   `Thread.Mutex` serialising all requests, per-request work that belongs in a shared
   cache, a layer doing I/O in a loop.
3. **Structural ⇒ analyse and propose the large refactor — surface it, don't silently
   band-aid.** Write: the **root cause**, the **target design** that is deterministic +
   performant + concurrent (e.g. shard the lock / per-key or per-shard locks / lock-free
   CAS instead of one mutex; one batched query instead of N+1 scattered across layers;
   an index or precompute instead of repeated scans; streaming instead of full-buffer),
   the **throwaway-patch alternative and why it's worse**, and the **blast radius**.
   This follows the patch-vs-refactor discipline (`AGENTS.md` Decomposition) — the call
   is surfaced to Indy, not made unilaterally. The test then pins the **target** bound,
   so the refactor is provably met and can't regress.
4. **Local ⇒ apply**, then re-measure the same counter on the same n-ladder and assert
   the growth ratio dropped to target. The before/after counter delta *is* the proof —
   pin it in the baseline file so a future regression fails the gate.
5. If the budget still can't be met after the agreed change, that's a **design finding** —
   surface it; never loosen the threshold silently.

Stack-specific must-knows:

- **Zig** — `std.testing.allocator` auto-detects leaks; verify cross-compile (`x86_64-linux`, `aarch64-linux`) since stdlib API may differ from macOS; `conn.query()` requires `.drain()`.
- **Python SDK** — assert API key not in debug output; HTTPS enforced; pagination doesn't load all pages in memory; rate-limit retry honours `Retry-After`.
- **Rust gRPC** — protobuf round-trip; streaming doesn't buffer full response; `tonic::Status` codes assert specific variant.
- **Rust HTTP** — `axum::extract::rejection` paths; payload too large (413); missing `Content-Type`.
- **React** — `axe` accessibility audit; no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with unsanitized input; controlled vs uncontrolled input switching.
- **Shell** — all variables quoted (`"$var"`); `set -euo pipefail`; no `eval` with user input; `mktemp` for temp files.
- **OpenAPI** — `schemathesis run --checks all`; `oasdiff breaking` in CI; `spectral lint` for style.

## OWASP for agent-bound data

Code paths sending data to LLMs / tool-calling agents (directly or via queue/DB/API):

- [ ] User-controlled input never concatenated raw into prompts; structured roles only
- [ ] Length-bounded, validated, sanitised against instruction-injection markers (`ignore previous`, role-confusion XML/JSON)
- [ ] Tool permissions scoped per-invocation, not globally granted
- [ ] Secrets/credentials/PII stripped before reaching the agent; opaque references only
- [ ] Agent output validated against allowlist/schema before any side effect; never `eval()` raw output
- [ ] Authorization re-checked at every hop; agent inherits caller's permissions, not service-level
- [ ] Audit log: who, input, tools called, output, side effects — tamper-resistant
- [ ] Fail-closed on any trust check failure — never silently fall back
