### Validation Checkpoints

- [ ] **Checkpoint 1:** `install.sh` tested on fresh VM
- [ ] **Checkpoint 2:** `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` diff reviewed
- [ ] **Checkpoint 3:** Mermaid Live links validated
- [ ] **Checkpoint 4:** Final approval before merge to `main`

### Blockers

None currently identified.

### Questions for Resolution

1. **Zoho Cliq Webhook:** Should `install.sh` notify Cliq on first install? (Optional)
2. **Agent Auto-Detection:** Should installer check agent versions or just directory existence?
3. **Mermaid Fallback:** How to handle agents without Mermaid support?
4. **Upgrade Strategy:** How to handle breaking changes to shared configs?

---

## Phase 3: Future Work (Planned 📋)

**Not Started**

### Potential Features

- Agent-specific optimizations (per-agent best practices)
- Cloud deployment of `install.sh` to `awakeninggit.e2enetworks.net`
- Zoho Cliq notification integration
- Support for additional AI agents beyond initial 6
- Versioning and upgrade automation
- Analytics: track agent usage patterns

---

- Created `project_status.md` (this file)
- Standardized filename conventions (lowercase: `project_spec.md`, `project_status.md`)

- Established Mermaid validation workflow
- Copied `CLAUDE.md` and `zoho-sprint.mjs` to ai-jumpstart repo

### 2026-02-03 (Phase 1)

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Agent A starts on `install.sh`
2. **Parallel:** Agent B begins `CLAUDE.md` migration
3. ~~**After CLAUDE.md:** Agent C migrates shared skills~~ ✅ **Complete**
4. **After A & B:** Agent D writes `README.md` with Mermaid
5. **Final:** Agent E performs cross-agent testing

**Human Action Required:**
- None currently; agents can proceed with assigned tasks
- Will need validation at checkpoints 1-4 (see Validation Checkpoints above)

**Note:** Skills migration (Agent C) completed ahead of schedule. Agent D can start on README once install.sh (Agent A) and CLAUDE.md (Agent B) are done.
