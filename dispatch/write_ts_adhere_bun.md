# write_ts_adhere_bun.md — TypeScript / Bun latent façade

This is the prose the AGENT reads before writing any `*.ts` / `*.tsx` / `*.js` / `*.jsx` file. It pairs with the deterministic façade `dispatch/write_ts_adhere_bun.sh` — the machine half that runs the mechanically-checkable subset and emits one verdict block. This document consolidates the former Bun/TypeScript rules merged with the TypeScript-relevant dissolved gate-card deltas (UI substitution, design-token): every original rule line is preserved verbatim (one forward-looking repoint to `write_zig.md`), each `## ` section now carries exactly one enforcement tag, and the dissolved gate-card prose is appended under "Merged from dissolved gate cards." Mechanical thresholds live once in the `.sh`; this file references rule codes, never restates the numbers.

**Signal legend** (printed by `write_ts_adhere_bun.sh`):

- 🟢 pass — deterministic check passed.
- 🔴 fail — deterministic check failed (or helper absent); STOP, fix, rerun.
- 🔵 DECIDE — judgment-only; no script can decide, the agent reads the section and makes the call (blocks the TURN, not the script).
- ⚪ delegated — the checker runs only in the product repo, not in dotfiles.

**Tag legend** — each section heading below carries one of:

- `> [DETERMINISTIC → <CODE>]` — a machine can pass/fail it; the `.sh` row for `<CODE>` (e.g. `UFS`, `FLL`, `UIS`, `DTK`, `TSC`) enforces it. `TODO-CHECK` marks a mechanizable rule with no helper wired yet (build-the-check). `NEW:<name>` marks a proposed-but-not-yet-existing code.
- `> [JUDGMENT → <CODE>]` — no script can decide; the agent decides at write time against the prose.
- `> [container]` — a non-enforcement wrapper heading (e.g. "Merged from dissolved gate cards"); its tagged subsections carry the real codes, and the coherence audit (§6.3) skips it.

See [`docs/DISPATCH_ARCHITECTURE.md`](../docs/DISPATCH_ARCHITECTURE.md) §3 for the tag grammar and semantic-anchor model.

# Bun / TypeScript discipline

Modelled on `write_zig.md`. Pre-design rules, decisive defaults, and the
anti-patterns each rule exists to prevent. Every rule has a one-line
"why" so you can judge edge cases.

## Scope

> [JUDGMENT → TSJ]

Triggers on every `Edit`/`Write` to:

- `*.ts`, `*.tsx`, `*.js`, `*.jsx` outside `vendor/`, `node_modules/`, `.next/`, `dist/`, `build/`.
- Any Bun-runtime entrypoint (`bun.lock`, `bunfig.toml`, files invoked via `bun run`).

Out of scope: framework-generated files (Next.js generated types, Astro `.astro`).

The **UI Component Substitution Gate** (the UI Component Substitution section below) and **GREPTILE GATE** (which carries RULE UFS, RULE TGU, RULE PRI for TypeScript) sit on top of this file — they fire in addition to these rules, not instead of them.

## §1 · TS FILE SHAPE DECISION (mandatory at PLAN)

> [JUDGMENT → FSD]

Before writing the first line of any new `*.ts`/`*.tsx` file under `src/`, `app/`, or `lib/`, print:

```
TS FILE SHAPE DECISION: <intended-path>
  Trigger: <new file | threshold-cross: <which>>
  Purpose: <one sentence — what this file's job is>
  Primary export: <ClassName | factory function | const | type-only module>
  Behaviour bound to state: <yes/no>
  Verdict: <class | factory | functions-module | type-only>
  Why not the other: <one sentence — required when verdict is conventional>
```

**Decision matrix:**

| Behaviour | State | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Operations bound to a single piece of state | yes (mutable, lifecycle) | **class** with `#private` fields |
| Operations on a passive value (validators, parsers, formatters) | no | **functions-module** (named exports) |
| One-shot construction returning a stateful holder | yes (frozen after init) | **factory function** returning `Object.freeze({...})` |
| Only types/interfaces/enums | n/a | **type-only module** |

**Threshold-cross binding** — same as Zig: an existing functions-module that's about to gain its first stateful operation rearchitects to `class` in the same diff. Don't grow a `let cachedX = …` at module scope to dodge the conversion.

**Override:** `TS FILE SHAPE DECISION: SKIPPED per user override (reason: ...)` — user-only, in this turn. Auto-mode does NOT cover it (mirrors Zig FILE SHAPE rule).

## §2 · `const` discipline

> [DETERMINISTIC → UFS]

_`UFS` is a universal rule **enforced once by `write_any`** (which fires for every source file); this façade carries its prose for the author but does not re-run `audit-ufs` — no redundant full-tree scan (`DISPATCH_ARCHITECTURE.md` §16, Decision 6)._

- **`const` by default. `let` only when the variable is reassigned in the same scope.** Never `let` "because I might change it later". A future-tense `let` is dead-on-arrival.
- **No `var`. Ever.** Hoisting is a bug nursery; the lint rule should be a hard error in `tsconfig`/`eslint.config.ts`.
- **Module-level constants are `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`** when they're tunables (timeouts, limits, magic numbers). `camelCase` when they're configuration values composed at runtime (`const config = {...}`).
- **RULE UFS — Named constants for repeated and semantic literals (applies to all source).**
  - **String literals used in ≥2 sites become a named const.** "It's just a label" is not an exception. Wire-format enum values (`"platform"`, `"self_managed"`, `"receive"`, `"stage"`) MUST be defined once as a SCREAMING_SNAKE const-as-namespace (`PROVIDER_MODE.platform`, `CHARGE_TYPE.receive`) and referenced everywhere else — including test fixtures, mock returns, and assertion arguments. Inline string repeats are a rule violation even if TypeScript narrows them.
  - **Numeric literals carrying semantic meaning become a named const** even at the first use site. Examples that always need a name: conversion factors (`NANOS_PER_USD`, `MS_PER_SECOND`, `BYTES_PER_MIB`), thresholds (`LOW_BALANCE_THRESHOLD_NANOS`, `MAX_RETRY_COUNT`), magic offsets, sub-cent rates. Bare digits like `1_000_000_000` in a `nanos / 1_000_000_000` expression are a smell — the unit suffix names the operation, but the constant names *what the divisor is*. Carve-out: **pin tests** where the literal IS the contract (`expect(formatDollars(4_710_000_000)).toBe("$4.71")`) — those keep the literal, with a `// pin test: literal is the contract` comment.
  - **Cross-runtime constants must be named identically** across Zig, TS, and JS (same SCREAMING_SNAKE identifier; case-only diff allowed for language idioms). When a constant exists in one runtime, the matching one in any sibling runtime carries the same name. `NANOS_PER_USD` is the canonical example: `pub const NANOS_PER_USD` in Zig, `export const NANOS_PER_USD` in TS, `export const NANOS_PER_USD` in JS — never `NANOS_PER_DOLLAR` in one and `NANOS_PER_USD` in another.
  - **Self-audit at HARNESS VERIFY.** Before declaring done, grep the diff for repeat string literals and bare-numeric divisors/multipliers — every hit either becomes a named const or earns the `// pin test` carve-out comment. Spec dimensions that introduce a new wire-format value, conversion factor, or threshold must define the constant in PLAN, not EXECUTE.

## §3 · Import discipline

> [DETERMINISTIC → TSC]

- **`import type { X } from "..."`** for type-only imports. Bun's TypeScript transpile drops type-only imports without analysis — using value imports for types adds bundle weight and complicates tree-shaking.
- **No default exports** for application code. Default exports break renaming, hide rebinding, and confuse `import` autocomplete. Exception: framework conventions that require it (Next.js page/layout, Astro components).
- **Side-effect imports last** (`import "./bootstrap"`). Distinguish `import "./reset.css"` from value imports by physical position — eyeballs need that signal.
- **Path aliases over `../../../`.** Configure in `tsconfig.json`/`bunfig.toml`. If you find yourself counting dots, the file is in the wrong directory.

## §4 · Bun-native primitives over Node compat

> [JUDGMENT → TSJ]

| Task | Use | Avoid (unless explicit reason) |
|---|---|---|
| HTTP server | `Bun.serve({ fetch, port })` | `express`, `fastify`, `hono` (unless a specific middleware is needed) |
| Filesystem read | `Bun.file(path).stream()` for unknown-size input; `.text()` / `.json()` / `.bytes()` only after size is bounded per §11 | `fs.promises.readFile` |
| Filesystem write | `await Bun.write(path, data)` | `fs.promises.writeFile` |
| SQLite | `import { Database } from "bun:sqlite"` | `better-sqlite3`, `sqlite3` |
| Test runner | `import { test, expect } from "bun:test"` | `vitest`, `jest`, `mocha` |
| Process spawn | `Bun.spawn(["cmd", "arg"])` | `child_process.spawn` |
| Hashing | `Bun.password.hash` / `Bun.CryptoHasher` | `crypto.createHash` for new code |
| Globbing | `new Bun.Glob(pattern).scan(...)` | `glob` package |
| Env | `Bun.env` (immutable view of `process.env`) | reading `process.env` directly when Bun-native works |

The Bun runtime is the constraint. If a dependency forces Node-compat, document the reason in a comment (`// using fs.promises because pdf-lib expects Node Buffer`).

## §5 · Type discipline at parse boundaries

> [JUDGMENT → TGU]

- **Never `any`.** Use `unknown` and narrow.
- **Narrow at parse boundaries** — when JSON crosses a network/storage boundary, validate with a real schema (Zod / Valibot / TypeBox). Trust nothing from outside the process.
- **Branded types for IDs** (`type WorkspaceId = string & { readonly _brand: "WorkspaceId" }`). Prevents passing a `UserId` where a `WorkspaceId` is expected — a compile-time bug class that's expensive at runtime.
- **No `as` casts** except: (a) const assertions (`as const`), (b) narrowing after a runtime check the compiler can't see (`x as NonEmpty<T>` after asserting `x.length > 0`).
- **Tagged unions over optional-field structs** (RULE TGU, applies to TypeScript too):
  ```ts
  // ❌ optional-field
  type Result = { ok: boolean; value?: T; error?: string };
  // ✅ tagged union
  type Result<T> = { ok: true; value: T } | { ok: false; error: string };
  ```

## §6 · File ordering

> [DETERMINISTIC → TSC]

```ts
// 1. Type-only imports
import type { Workspace, User } from "./types";

// 2. Value imports
import { z } from "zod";
import { Database } from "bun:sqlite";

// 3. Module-local types
type Internal = { … };

// 4. Module-level consts
const TIMEOUT_MS = 5_000;
const STATEMENTS = { listAll: "SELECT * FROM ws" } as const;

// 5. Main export (class | factory | functions-module)
export class WorkspaceStore { … }

// 6. Helpers (private to module)
function parseRow(row: unknown): Workspace { … }
```

Side-effect imports land **after** value imports if order matters; otherwise group with value imports.

## §7 · Naming

> [DETERMINISTIC → TSC]

| Construct | Convention | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Variable / function | camelCase | `parseWorkspace`, `cachedTokens` |
| Class / type / interface | PascalCase | `WorkspaceStore`, `RouteHandler` |
| Enum & enum members | PascalCase / PascalCase | `Status.Pending`, `Status.Active` |
| Module-level tunable constants | SCREAMING_SNAKE | `MAX_RETRIES`, `TIMEOUT_MS` |
| Filename | kebab-case matching default-ish export | `workspace-store.ts` |
| Test file | `<unit>.test.ts` (Bun convention) | `workspace-store.test.ts` |
| Private class field | `#name` (real private, not `_name`) | `#db`, `#cache` |

## §8 · `bun:test` discipline

> [DETERMINISTIC → TODO-CHECK]

- **One test file per source file**, sibling-named (`workspace-store.test.ts` next to `workspace-store.ts`). Mirrors RULE TST-NAM.
- **Use `bun:test` exports** — `test`, `expect`, `describe`, `beforeEach`, `afterEach`, `mock`. Never import from `vitest`/`jest` even if the API looks identical.
- **No milestone IDs in test names** (RULE TST-NAM). Tests describe behaviour, not provenance.
- **Integration tests opt out via filename**: `workspace-store.integration.test.ts` — Bun pattern for filtered runs (`bun test --test-name-pattern '\.integration\.'`).
- **Snapshot tests are forbidden by default.** They drift, the diff is opaque, and "looks right" isn't a behaviour assertion. Only land a snapshot when you genuinely have no other way to assert (rare).

## §9 · Error handling

> [JUDGMENT → TSJ]

Pick one style per module — never mix:

- **Throw** (`throw new TypeError(...)`) when the caller cannot reasonably handle the error and the program should die or unwind.
- **Result-style** (`type Result<T,E> = { ok: true; value: T } | { ok: false; error: E }`) when the caller routinely handles the failure and a thrown error would force every caller to wrap in `try/catch`.

In a Result-style module, **never throw**. In a throw-style module, **never return `Result<…>`**. Mixing forces every caller to know which mode each function is in — unmaintainable.

`Error` subclasses must be named after *what is wrong*, not *when it happened* (mirrors RULE NLG): `WorkspaceNotFound`, not `LegacyWorkspaceLookupError`.

## §10 · Anti-patterns (named, banned)

> [DETERMINISTIC → TSC]

| Pattern | Why banned |
|---|---|
| `let` for "I might change it later" | Future-tense reassignment is a bug pretending to be flexibility. |
| `any` to silence the type-checker | The check exists to find this. |
| `// @ts-ignore` / `// @ts-expect-error` without an issue link | Comments rot; a permanent `@ts-ignore` is a permanent lie. |
| Default exports for application code | Renames cascade. Imports lie about what they import. |
| Re-exporting everything from `index.ts` | Hides dependency graph, defeats tree-shaking. Re-export only what's part of the public surface. |
| `Object.assign` for shallow merging | Use spread (`{ ...a, ...b }`). `Object.assign` mutates the first arg — bug class waiting to happen. |
| Top-level `console.log` left in source | Use a real logger, or remove before commit. Audit catches this in pre-commit if a logger gate exists. |
| `process.env.X` reads scattered through code | Read once at module init, freeze, export typed. Scattered reads make config opaque. |

## §11 · Runtime resource discipline

> [DETERMINISTIC → TODO-CHECK]

TypeScript makes unbounded work look cheap. Bun will still allocate, queue, block, and leak process handles if the code shape is sloppy.

### Promise concurrency

- **No unbounded `Promise.all(items.map(...))`** on data from users, files, network, databases, or command output. Use a concurrency limiter, chunked loop, or streaming transform.
- **Every fan-out declares its bound** near the call site: `MAX_CONCURRENT_FETCHES`, `MAX_PARALLEL_FILES`, etc. Numeric literals follow RULE UFS in §2.
- **Retry loops are bounded**: max attempts, delay/backoff, jitter when multiple clients may retry, and an abort path.
- **Long-running async work accepts an `AbortSignal`** or has an equivalent owner-controlled cancellation path.
- **`Promise.race` timeouts cancel the loser.** A timer-only race that leaves work running is a leak.

### Memory shape

- **Do not materialize unknown-size input.** Avoid `await Bun.file(path).text()`, `response.text()`, `response.json()`, or `Array.from(...)` when size is not bounded. Stream, chunk, or reject at a named limit.
- **Do not accumulate transform results by default.** Prefer `for await` streaming or chunked processing for large file, HTTP, or command-output flows.
- **Large JSON parse/stringify is both memory and Central Processing Unit (CPU) work.** Put it behind a size limit or move it out of request-critical code.
- **Clear resource handles in `finally`.** Timers, intervals, subprocesses, file handles, and temporary listeners must be cleaned even on thrown errors.

### Timeout and cancellation

Every network request, subprocess wrapper, file watcher, long poll, or task queue wait added by a diff needs a timeout or cancellation owner.

```ts
const controller = new AbortController();
const timeout = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MILLISECONDS);
try {
  return await fetch(url, { signal: controller.signal });
} finally {
  clearTimeout(timeout);
}
```

Use a local helper only when it preserves the same visible ownership: who starts the timer, who aborts, and who clears it.
Returning a `Response` from a helper transfers body consumption outside this timeout; only do that when the caller owns a second timeout.

### Bun subprocess cleanup

- `Bun.spawn` callers must consume, redirect, or intentionally ignore stdout/stderr. Do not leave pipes unread.
- Every spawned process is awaited, killed on timeout, or tied to an owner cleanup path.
- Wrapper tests cover the timeout/kill path, not just the success exit code.

### CPU-bound work

- CPU-heavy synchronous work does not live directly in request handlers without a named bound. Examples: large JSON serialization, hashing loops, compression, directory walks, and bulk formatting.
- Worker usage declares input size, concurrency, termination, and error propagation. A worker that can fail silently is a hidden hang.
- Prefer one parse/config load at module startup over repeated parse inside handlers or command loops.

## §12 · Override syntax

> [JUDGMENT → TSJ]

Per-rule override:

```
BUN RULE <§N>: SKIPPED per user override (reason: ...)
```

immediately preceding the edit. **User-invokable only.** Generic "scope creep" / "save for later" not valid — name a concrete external constraint (third-party-API shape, framework requirement, dependency mismatch).

## §13 · Family

> [DETERMINISTIC → FLL]

- Universal rules (RULE UFS, RULE TGU, RULE PRI, RULE FLL, RULE ORP, RULE TST-NAM) live in `docs/greptile-learnings/RULES.md` and apply to TypeScript via the **GREPTILE GATE**.
- Frontend visual primitives live in the UI Component Substitution section of this façade (UI GATE).
- Length caps live in `dispatch/write_any.md` (LENGTH GATE — file ≤ 350, fn ≤ 50, method ≤ 70 — same as every other source language).
- This file is the **TypeScript / Bun-specific** layer that those universal rules cannot express. Read it once at session start, re-read on sub-task shape change.

## Merged from dissolved gate cards

> [container]

The TypeScript-relevant gate cards (`ui-substitution`, `design-token`) dissolve into this façade. Their prose is preserved verbatim below (headings demoted one level; words unchanged), and — matching `write_zig.md` — each subsection carries its own enforcement tag (`UIS` for the UI gate, `DTK` for the design-token gate). The mechanical checks delegate to `make lint`: the audit scripts (`msid-ui.sh`, `design-tokens.sh`) scan `ui/packages/**`, which exists in the product repo, not in dotfiles, so the dispatch emits `⚪ DELEGATED` for them here.

### UI Component Substitution (UI GATE)

> [DETERMINISTIC → UIS]


**Family:** Frontend design-system discipline. **Source:** `AGENTS.md` (project-side guard). Authoritative primitive set: `ui/packages/design-system/src/index.ts`.

**Triggers** — every `Edit`/`Write` to a `*.tsx` / `*.jsx` under `ui/packages/app/` **or** `ui/packages/website/`. Both packages share the same design-system source of truth (`@usezombie/design-system`), so the same primitive-first standard applies. Tests (`*.test.tsx`) and Playwright specs (`tests/e2e/**`) are exempt — they assert on rendered DOM and frequently use raw selectors.

**Override:** `UI GATE: SKIPPED per user override (reason: ...)` immediately preceding the edit.

#### What this gate enforces

> [DETERMINISTIC → UIS]

The design-system package (`ui/packages/design-system/src/index.ts` exports — `Section`, `Card`, `Badge`, `Button`, `Input`, `Dialog`, `Pagination`, `EmptyState`, `Tooltip`, `List`/`ListItem`, `WakePulse`, `Terminal`, `InstallBlock`, etc.) is the source of truth for visual primitives. Raw HTML in either dashboard or marketing files drifts from those tokens silently.

**Marketing-display typography — primitives now exist.** `<DisplayXL>` (marketing hero `<h1>`, `text-fluid-hero`) and `<DisplayLG>` (section heads `<h2>`, `text-fluid-display-lg`) ship from `@usezombie/design-system` and compose `font-mono` + the fluid text/leading/tracking tokens internally. Use them on marketing-display surfaces. Raw `<h1>+utilities` is no longer the carve-out — UI GATE blocks it. The dashboard's `<PageTitle>` (`text-heading ≈ 18px`) remains the correct primitive for app surfaces.

This gate enforces "use the primitive when one exists" without enumerating the primitives in this rule (so the rule scales as the design-system grows).

#### Pre-edit check

> [DETERMINISTIC → UIS]

1. Read (or recall) the design-system index. Treat its exports as the substitute set.
2. For each raw HTML element your edit adds (`<section>`, `<button>`, `<input>`, `<article>`, `<dialog>`, `<dl>`, `<table>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<form>`, etc.), check the index for a matching primitive. If one exists, use it.
3. Use `asChild` when you need the underlying HTML tag for semantics:

   ```tsx
   <Section asChild>
     <section aria-label="...">…</section>
   </Section>
   ```

#### Required output (default — one line)

> [DETERMINISTIC → UIS]

```
UI GATE: <file> | primitives:<list> | raw-kept:<list with one-word reason each | none>
```

Multi-line block fires only when raw-kept is non-empty:

```
UI GATE: <file>
  Primitives used: <list>
  Raw HTML kept:
    - <element>: <reason>  (e.g. "ul: no DS primitive")
    - ...
```

#### Self-audit (end-of-turn)

> [DETERMINISTIC → UIS]

```bash
git diff -U0 HEAD -- 'ui/packages/app/**/*.tsx' 'ui/packages/website/src/**/*.tsx' \
  | grep -v -E '\.test\.tsx|tests/e2e/' \
  | grep -E '^\+.*<(section|button|input|dialog|article|nav|header|form)\b' \
  | head
```

Non-empty is a violation unless every match has a printed "Raw HTML kept" justification in the corresponding gate block.

### Design Tokens (DESIGN TOKEN GATE)

> [DETERMINISTIC → DTK]


**Family:** Frontend design-system discipline (paired with the UI Component Substitution Gate). **Source:** `AGENTS.md` (project-side guard). Authoritative token surface: `ui/packages/design-system/src/theme.css` (Layer-2 `@theme inline`).

**Triggers** — every `Edit`/`Write` to `*.tsx` / `*.jsx` under `ui/packages/app/` **or** `ui/packages/website/`. Tests (`*.test.tsx`) and Playwright specs (`tests/e2e/**`) are exempt — they assert on rendered DOM and frequently use raw selectors.

**Override:** `// DESIGN TOKEN: SKIPPED per user override (reason: ...)` immediately preceding the affected line. Reasons must cite a concrete constraint — "bespoke per-surface grid template", "tight UI chrome width with no equivalent token", "external library prop expects px-string" — not "looks the same" / "shorter to write". Auto-mode does NOT cover the override.

#### What this gate enforces

> [DETERMINISTIC → DTK]

The design-system package exposes named Tailwind utilities for every typographic and layout primitive (`text-display-xl`, `text-eyebrow`, `leading-prose`, `max-w-narrow`, `tracking-display-md`, `duration-snap`, etc.). Raw arbitrary values bypass the published scale. Over time that drift dilutes the system; the moment one surface ships `text-[14px] leading-[1.6]`, others copy the pattern.

This gate blocks arbitrary classes **when an equivalent token utility exists**. It does NOT block:

- Tailwind state selectors (`data-[active=true]:bg-accent`)
- Pseudo-element `content-[...]`
- Bespoke `grid-cols-[...]` / `grid-rows-[...]` (per-surface templates)
- `calc(...)` expressions that consume a token (`h-[calc(100vh-var(--header-height))]`)
- Token-using shadows (`shadow-[0_0_0_3px_var(--pulse-glow)]`)

#### Pre-edit check

> [DETERMINISTIC → DTK]

1. Read (or recall) `ui/packages/design-system/src/theme.css` — the Layer-2 `@theme inline { ... }` block is the authoritative utility surface.

2. The available token utilities are exactly the bridged names:

   | Family | Utilities |
   |---|---|
   | Text size | `text-{label,eyebrow,body-sm,body,body-lg,heading,display-md,display-lg,display-xl}` |
   | Fluid text | `text-fluid-{display-md,display-lg,hero}` |
   | Tracking | `tracking-{display-xl,display-lg,display-md,eyebrow,label}` |
   | Line-height | `leading-{display-xl,display-lg,display-md,heading,eyebrow,body-lg,body,body-sm,label,mono,prose}` |
   | Max width | `max-w-{trim,narrow,measure,form,wide,content,tagline,prose}` |
   | Min width | `min-w-{trim,narrow,measure,form,wide,content,tagline,prose}` |
   | Spacing | `{p,m,gap,space-{x,y}}-{xs,sm,md,lg,xl,2xl,3xl,4xl,5xl,6xl}` |
   | Motion | `duration-snap`, `ease-snap` |
   | Radius | `rounded-{sm,md,lg}` |
   | Color | semantic tokens only — `bg-{background,card,popover,primary,secondary,muted,accent,destructive,…}`, `text-{foreground,muted-foreground,text,text-muted,text-subtle,…}`, `border-{border,border-strong,input,ring}`, status tokens `text-{success,warn,error,info,evidence}` / `text-on-pulse` |

3. For every arbitrary `*-[...]` class your edit adds, ask: **does a token utility exist?**
   - If yes, use it.
   - If no, the arbitrary is allowed without an override comment.
   - If close but not exact, prefer the token. The system absorbs ±1–2 px differences; over hundreds of callsites the consistency dominates the per-callsite shift.

#### Required output (default — one line)

> [DETERMINISTIC → DTK]

```
DESIGN TOKEN GATE: <file> | arbitraries-kept: <list with one-word reason each | none>
```

Multi-line block fires only when `arbitraries-kept` is non-empty:

```
DESIGN TOKEN GATE: <file>
  Arbitraries kept:
    - <class>: <reason>  (e.g. "grid-cols-[2fr_1fr_1fr_1fr]: bespoke footer grid")
    - <class>: <reason>
    ...
```

#### Scope (M70)

> [DETERMINISTIC → DTK]

`design-tokens.sh` walks the **full ui/packages working tree** via `git ls-files`. The index includes staged-but-not-yet-committed content, so a fix staged in pre-commit satisfies the check on the same hook run. The previous `--diff` (`BASE...HEAD`) default was retired with M70 — at pre-commit time `HEAD` is the prior commit, leaving the gate blind to the index.

`--all` is accepted as a back-compat alias for the default. `--staged` is preserved as an opt-in narrowing mode for iterative dev loops. `--diff` is rejected with exit 2 + a pointer to this section.

#### Self-audit (end-of-turn)

> [DETERMINISTIC → DTK]

```bash
audits/design-tokens.sh           # full-codebase scan (default)
audits/design-tokens.sh --staged  # opt-in narrowing for iterative dev
```

The script lives in the project repo at `audits/design-tokens.sh` (symlinked from `~/Projects/dotfiles/audits/`). It prints `file:line` + suggested token utility for every blocking violation and exits 1 on any.

A clean run is required before HARNESS VERIFY can advance.

The project repo is also expected to wire the audit into `make/quality.mk` `_website_lint` and `_app_lint` targets so `make lint` catches regressions:

```make
_website_lint:
	@echo "→ [website] Running Oxlint + TypeScript check..."
	@cd ui/packages/website && bun run lint
	@cd ui/packages/website && bun run typecheck
	@echo "→ [website] Running design-token audit..."
	@audits/design-tokens.sh
	@echo "✓ [website] Lint passed"
```

#### Family rules

> [DETERMINISTIC → DTK]

This gate composes with the UI Component Substitution Gate. Order of operations on a fresh `.tsx` edit:

1. **UI GATE** — pick the primitive (`<Card>`, `<Section>`, `<Button>`, `<DisplayXL>`, …)
2. **DESIGN TOKEN GATE** — pick the token utility (`text-body`, `leading-body`, `max-w-narrow`)
3. **UFS GATE** — pick a named const for any repeated string literal
4. **LENGTH GATE** — keep the file ≤350 lines

A `.tsx` that passes all four reads as system-conformant without spelunking into the design-system source.

#### Why a gate, not a lint rule

> [DETERMINISTIC → DTK]

Three reasons:

1. **Cross-package coupling.** The token set lives in `ui/packages/design-system`; the consumers live in `ui/packages/{app,website}`. A single oxlint config can't see across the boundary cleanly. The audit script reads the diff and the theme.css utilities — it's the right shape.

2. **Inline override.** Some `-[...]` classes are intentional and irreplaceable (bespoke grids, `calc(...)`, status-dot sizes). The comment-based override fits the existing gate idiom and gives reviewers a paper trail of *why* each arbitrary stayed.

3. **HARNESS VERIFY integration.** Gates are the canonical end-of-turn audit point. Lint rules surface in editor noise but miss the agentic lifecycle. The gate's pre-edit one-liner + end-of-turn self-audit puts the discipline in the model's hot path.

#### When tokens are missing

> [DETERMINISTIC → DTK]

If the arbitrary you want is a legitimate design value that simply has no token yet, **extend the design system in the same commit**:

1. Add `--<family>-<name>` to `ui/packages/design-system/src/tokens.css`
2. Forward to Tailwind via `@theme inline` in `ui/packages/design-system/src/theme.css`
3. Migrate your callsite to the new utility
4. Add the utility to the table above in this gate body (same dotfiles commit — Invariance Suite Gate applies)

This is the path to a system that grows without dilution.
