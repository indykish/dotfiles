# dispatch/write_sql.sh — the SQL / schema dispatch, DETERMINISTIC façade.
#
# Pairs with dispatch/write_sql.md (the LATENT façade — prose the agent reads).
# This .sh runs the mechanically-checkable subset of the SQL/schema discipline and
# emits ONE verdict block. The latent trigger ("about to write a schema/*.sql file")
# dispatches here; everything below is deterministic and re-runnable.
#
#   dispatch/write_sql.sh <schema/file.sql> [...]   # explicit targets (EXECUTE)
#   dispatch/write_sql.sh --staged                  # staged schema/*.sql (HARNESS VERIFY, pre-commit)
#
# Layering:  AGENTS.md → write_sql.md (latent) → write_sql.sh (this) → audits/*.sh
# Signals:   🟢 pass · 🔴 fail (blocks) · 🔵 DECIDE (judgment; blocks the TURN, not the script) · ⚪ delegated
# Exit:      0 = mechanical gates pass · 1 = ≥1 failed · 2 = usage error.
#
# Note: STS/NSQ/SGR are mechanizable SQL-hygiene rules with no leaf check wired yet
# (write_sql.md tags them TODO-CHECK). They stay in docs/greptile-learnings/RULES.md
# (retained) and the GREPTILE GATE enforces them by review until a leaf exists.
# SCH's pre-2.0 forbidden-token floor (no ALTER/DROP/SELECT 1; in schema/*.sql) is
# itself a build-the-check (TODO-CHECK) candidate; the teardown-vs-ALTER disposition
# call above it stays JUDGMENT (which file to rm, which @embedFile, which migration index).
