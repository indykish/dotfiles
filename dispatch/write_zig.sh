# dispatch/write_zig.sh — the Zig dispatch, DETERMINISTIC façade.
#
# Pairs with dispatch/write_zig.md (the LATENT façade — prose the agent reads).
# This .sh runs the mechanically-checkable subset of the Zig discipline and
# emits ONE verdict block. The latent trigger ("about to write a *.zig file")
# dispatches here; everything below is deterministic and re-runnable — same
# input, same verdict, no calendar/branch dependence.
#
#   dispatch/write_zig.sh <file.zig> [...]   # explicit targets (EXECUTE)
#   dispatch/write_zig.sh --staged           # staged *.zig (HARNESS VERIFY, pre-commit)
#
# Layering:  AGENTS.md → write_zig.md (latent) → write_zig.sh (this) → audits/*.sh
# Signals:   🟢 pass · 🔴 fail (blocks) · 🔵 DECIDE (judgment; blocks the TURN, not the script)
# Exit:      0 = mechanical gates pass · 1 = ≥1 failed · 2 = usage error.
