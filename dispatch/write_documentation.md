# write_documentation.md — published-documentation dispatch

Read `docs/DOCUMENTATION_RULES.md` before
writing customer-facing documentation. This general rule runs before narrower
guides selected by domain-specific packs (changelog voice, when selected) and
before prose about the dispatch model.

## Trigger

- Editing a published Markdown JSX (MDX) page.
- Editing a reusable `snippets/*.mdx` fragment.
- Editing public OpenAPI summaries, descriptions, examples, options, or errors.
- Editing a customer-facing readme or reference page.
<!-- oracle-packs:start domain.changelog -->
- Editing `docs/CHANGELOG_VOICE.md` or `docs/DISPATCH_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

`changelog.mdx` history remains excluded from the general page shape. New
changelog entries read this dispatch first, then `write_changelog.md`.
<!-- oracle-packs:end -->

## Required order

1. Read `docs/DOCUMENTATION_RULES.md` and identify the page scope.
2. Read the repository glossary and content boundaries.
3. Verify claims against runtime code, OpenAPI, and command help.
4. Write the smallest complete page.
5. Run the repository-owned pre-commit checker.

## Enforcement

🟣 **Delegated.** Each repository owns its checker: rules resolve from this
repository's own `docs/`, materialised here by `orly init`. Dotfiles owns the
rule and the read trigger. Repository hooks own mechanical enforcement.

Before committing, cite the applied Documentation (DOC) rule identifiers:

```text
📖 DOC READ: docs/DOCUMENTATION_RULES.md — scope <page|fragment|OpenAPI|changelog>; DOC-<rules applied>
```

## Family

- `docs/DOCUMENTATION_RULES.md` — general customer-documentation rules.
- Selected changelog and HTTP packs provide their narrower archive, voice, and
  API design rules.
