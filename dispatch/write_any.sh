# dispatch/write_any.sh — the cross-cutting authoring dispatch, DETERMINISTIC façade.
#
# Pairs with dispatch/write_any.md (the LATENT façade — prose the agent reads).
# Fires for ANY source file, IN ADDITION to the language façade (write_zig /
# write_ts_adhere_bun / write_sql). Runs the mechanically-checkable cross-cutting
# subset and emits ONE verdict block.

#   dispatch/write_any.sh <file> [...]   # explicit targets (EXECUTE)
#   dispatch/write_any.sh --staged       # staged source (CONFORM, pre-commit)
#
# Layering:  AGENTS.md → write_any.md (latent) → write_any.sh (this) → audits/*.sh
# Signals:   🟢 pass · 🔴 fail (blocks) · 🔵 DECIDE (judgment; blocks the TURN, not the script) · ⚪ delegated
# Exit:      0 = mechanical gates pass · 1 = ≥1 failed · 2 = usage error.
#
# Leaf modes are verified against each script's own arg-parser (lib.sh warns the
# contracts are NON-UNIFORM): ufs.sh accepts --all + --staged (--diff retired
# M70); logging.sh / error-codes.sh / msid-ui.sh all accept --staged.
# The fn≤50/method≤70 sub-cap (write_any.md, file-length card) is a TODO-CHECK:
# dispatch_length_gate enforces only the file cap; no fn/method leaf is wired yet.

# pass gracefully on empty input. So it can't run in dotfiles — delegate it; the
